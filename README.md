Simple Day Planner that displays the date at the top and has a row for every hour that can be edited to save tasks / events for that day.  The rows are color coded using jquery and supplied stylesheet so that the hours that are already past are grey, the current hour is red and the future hours are green. Saved tasks are persistent (after clicking the save button) through refreshes. Used moment js legacy code to retrieve and manipulate current date/time data. Code is generally clean and efficient although would have liked to condensed button listeners into a single function.
